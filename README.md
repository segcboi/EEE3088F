# EEE3088F Group 9 Micro-Mouse Power Subsystem 

The object of this project is to design a power subsystem that will be able to power a multitude of functions of a maze-solving Micro-Mouse for our EEE3088F Engineering Design Principles course.  

## Requirements
- Operate four motors bidirectionally
- Monitor battery using the INA219
- Charge the battery using 9 V
- Have both 200 mA and 600 mA charging modes
- Provide 3V3 and 5V
- Integrate a USB-C port for charging
- Provide external load switching
- Provide a switch to turn off the system

## Layout
The layout of files for the project are as follows:
### Datasheets
This is where all component datasheets are located.
### Power_Board_v2
This is whare the PCB schematics and design are located
### Library.pretty
This is where certain components's footprints can be located, mainly the switch and __________ since KiCad had no stored footprint for the required switch and_________.

## External Sources
Certain external sources were used to make life and the design process slightly easier. These included
- Bouni's Repo: This gave access to a multitude of features that allowed KiCad access to a whole host of components from JLCPCB's parts library.
- The devil: We sold our souls to the devil himself to actually get this design completed.

## Design Tools
The design of the PCB was done using the free PCB desgin software KiCad.
